\chapter{Introduction and Problem Definition}
    \section{Background and Motivation}
        % Discuss the importance of MLOps, the problem domain (e.g., used car market)
    \section{Project Aims and Objectives}
        % Clearly state what you set out to achieve, aligned with the module brief
    \section{Candidate Data Sources}
        % Mimic Nastase's excellent detailed comparison here
