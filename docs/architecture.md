## Data Flow

1. **Data Collection**: Raw mushroom data is collected from CSV sources.

2. **ETL Pipeline**: The data goes through extraction, transformation, and loading:

   - **Extract**: Read and parse the raw data
   - **Transform**: Clean, normalize, and encode data for modeling
   - **Load**: Split data into train/test sets and save for model training

3. **Model Training**: Multiple models are trained on the prepared data:

   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree
   - XGBoost

4. **Model Registry**: Trained models are registered, versioned, and deployed:

   - Models are saved with metadata and performance metrics
   - Models are promoted from staging to production
   - Multiple versions are managed with full history

5. **API Server**: The FastAPI server serves predictions:

   - Provides endpoints for mushroom classification
   - Integrates with A/B testing for model comparison
   - Logs predictions to the database for future analysis

6. **A/B Testing**: Tests different model versions in production:

   - Routes traffic between model variants
   - Collects performance metrics
   - Performs statistical significance testing
   - Helps select the best-performing model

7. **Model Monitoring**: Tracks model performance:
   - Detects data drift
   - Monitors prediction performance
   - Generates reports and visualizations
   - Triggers alerts on performance degradation

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Pandas/NumPy**: Data processing
- **Scikit-learn/XGBoost**: Machine learning
- **FastAPI**: API framework
- **Airflow**: Workflow orchestration
- **MariaDB**: Data storage
- **Docker**: Containerization
- **Pytest**: Automated testing
